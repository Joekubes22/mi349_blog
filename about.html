<h2>About the author</h2>

<p>I (Joe Kubeshesky) am a current student and senior at Michigan State university studying Information Science at the 
    school of Communication Arts and Sciences. I have been accepted into the Media and Information linked masters program
    with a focus on Human Computer Interaction (HCI). I grew up in livonia Michigan, a suburb of Detroit Michigan. I played football, 
    basketball, and baseball growing up and through highschool. I hope to bring Tech news in a fun and informaitve way to the viewers 
    here on TechBased.
</p>

<p>My love for technology birthed the news blog TechBased. I always seemed to be drawn to apple after reciving
    an Ipod Nano as a christmas gift when I was a kid. after that I got an Ipod shuffle which was the coolest thing
    to me. I could play games, go on youtube, and browse the web. The Ipod touch was the device that made me fall in love
    with technology. My first iphone was the Iphone 5s which was an awesome device at the time. since then I have had an Iphone 
    6s, Iphone 8, and am currently on the Iphone 11 pro.
